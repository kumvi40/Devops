Ansible useful commands :
============================

Where Should I Put My ansible.cfg File? 
Ansible looks for an ansible.cfg file in the following places, in this order: 
1. File specified by the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable 
2. ./ansible.cfg (ansible.cfg in the current directory) 
3. ~/.ansible.cfg (.ansible.cfg in your home directory) 
4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

ansible.cfg:
===========
ansible.cfg file that specifies the location of the inventory file (hostfile), the user to SSH (remote_user), and the SSH private key (private_key_file).

[root@sso-ansible-u200398 staging]# cat ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = ./hosts


hosts:
=========
[root@sso-ansible-u200398 staging]# cat hosts
[webservers]
korva04-P3081

[dbservers]
korva04-I5744

[control]
sso-ansible-u200398 ansible_connection=local

=================

ansible commands:
 -> ansible webservers -m ping
 
  ansible testserver -m command -a uptime 
  
  -a -> argument to the command
  
   -s > tell ansible to sudo as root
   
  -> To run playbook : ansible-playbook <playbook>

==================================


What is roles?
Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure.
 Example project structure:
site.yml 
webservers.yml 
fooservers.yml 
roles/ 
	common/ 
		files/ 
		templates/ 
		tasks/ 
		handlers/ 
		vars/ 
		meta/ 
	webservers/ 
		files/ 
		templates/ 
		tasks/ 
		handlers/ 
		vars/ 
		meta/
In a playbook, it would look like this: 
--
- hosts: webservers 
  roles: 
   - common 
   - webserver
